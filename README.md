1. `vue-deno-weather` - based off `vue-deno-simple` and modified using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com), utilising [weather.py](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/quickstart-resources/blob/main/weather-server-python/weather.py) from the [Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server Developer Quickstart](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server).

## Pre-requisites
The following will be required:

1. Node.js - https://nodejs.org/
